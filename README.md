# Quantum Computing: A Practical Perspective
This is the official repository of the course "Quantum Computing: A Practical Perspective", offered by NECSTLab @ Politecnico di Milano, in collaboration with MathWorks.

## Course Details

This course aims to introduce the basic notions to design, develop, and analyze algorithms for quantum computers. In the last decades, the state of the art has produced an extraordinary improvement for quantum architectures, that are able to tackle complex problems, achieving extremely reduced execution time if compared to classical computation. Yet, current limits regarding the number of available qubits and noise intensity strongly limit their potential. Therefore, a quantum engineer needs to know how to design algorithms, identify their bottlenecks, and adopt effective solutions to mitigate noise.This course aims to provide students with the necessary notions to use MathWorks MATLAB Support Package for Quantum Computing, in order to design quantum algorithms, simulate them locally, run them on real quantum hardware through cloud-based services, visualize and analyze their circuits and their output. Students will see practical examples of notorious algorithms, such as the mathematical optimization frameworks known as QUBO. They will also be introduced to error mitigation and correction techniques. At the end of the course, students will work on a project, aiming to consider real use cases and strengthen their capabilities in quantum computation.
